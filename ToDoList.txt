To Do:

1. Context free draft activity 2
2. README with steps to set up and script that will automate setup
3. Talk with Katie
4. Laura will finish up activity 3
5. How to handle Bayes Rules! Explanation in our activity -- essentially quoted. Use callout box, cite location -- show to Mine and see what she thinks and/or would prefer.

** Make sure in activity 2 work to transition from looking at the guts to using functionality and packages -- check out Bayes Rules! and Monika's books
